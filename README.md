## Roll control loop simulation
- For given roll control loop, use the Runge-Kutta4 method with sampling time of 0.5ms for 2 seconds.
- Calculate the response of the roll attitude control loop under the various actuator bandwidth and roll attitude command with its initial roll angle
- build the program with `make main`
